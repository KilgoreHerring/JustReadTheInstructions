The TVAS will take into account: (a) the guaranteed pension income and any lump sum you are entitled to under the DB scheme; (b) the cash equivalent transfer value (CETV) offered; (c) projected investment returns and the income that could be generated in the receiving scheme; (d) the impact of charges on the projected benefits; (e) the critical yield required to match your DB benefits. The results of the TVAS will form part of our suitability report to you.",
                "guidance": "The TVAS is a core component of pension transfer advice. It must use FCA-compliant methodology and assumptions. The critical yield shows the investment return needed in the receiving scheme to match the DB benefits. A high critical yield relative to realistic expected returns is a strong indicator that transfer is not suitable. Ensure the TVAS is produced using approved software."
